The Python directory once worked well in 2D, with bacteria-shaped cells. The 3D Python code was experimental, but was
abandoned after the umpteenth time it stopped working due to Python's inherent instability... at which point we moved to C++.

The C++ directory contains the prototype 3D code in C++.
